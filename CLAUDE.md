# GCSE Computer Science Teaching Project

## Overview
This project helps teach Nathaniel (14 years old) GCSE Computer Science, focusing on J277/02: Computational thinking, algorithms and programming. This is supplementary home teaching alongside school curriculum.

## Teaching Strategy
- Focus on understanding "under-the-hood" concepts
- Binary/Boolean logic foundation before programming fundamentals
- Weekly lessons with more time per topic than school allows
- Structured progression through specification

## Current Progress
### Completed Topics (J277/01):
- **1.2.3 Units** - Basic understanding established
- **1.2.4 Data storage** - Binary and hexadecimal number systems, bit shifting, binary addition
- **2.4 Boolean logic** - Basic gates (NOT, AND, OR), truth tables introduced

### Next Topics to Cover:
1. **2.4 Boolean logic** (continuation) - Combined gates, circuit analysis
2. **2.2 Programming fundamentals** - Data types, variables, operators
3. **2.1 Algorithms** - Flowcharts, pseudocode, searching, sorting

## Directory Structure
Each lesson follows format: `XXX-Y.Y.Y-topic_name` where:
- XXX = sequence number (001, 002, etc.)
- Y.Y.Y = specification section number
- topic_name = specification section name with underscores

## Materials for Each Lesson
- lesson_plan.html - Teaching approach and explanations
- worksheet.html - Practice exercises  
- worksheet_answers.html - Solutions
- cheat_sheet.html - Key information summary

## HTML Theme Specifications
All materials use a custom HTML theme with:
- **Student Name**: "Nathaniel's GCSE Computer Science" in header
- **Color Scheme**: Blue header (#2c3e50), light blue accents (#3498db), clean white background
- **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts optimized for printing
- **Print Optimization**: CSS media queries for clean PDF printing
- **Responsive Design**: Works on screen and mobile devices
- **Professional Layout**: Clean spacing, clear headings, bordered tables

## Key Teaching Principles
- Use analogies for complex concepts
- Connect programming to boolean logic foundation
- Exam-style questions preparation
- Practical understanding over memorization
- **IMPORTANT: Always check OCR specification requirements BEFORE creating any lesson plans or materials**
- Keep worksheets to 30 minutes maximum (supplementary to school work)

## GitHub Pages Setup
- **Repository**: https://github.com/slimkrazy/nathaniel-cs-gsce.git
- **GitHub Pages URL**: https://slimkrazy.github.io/nathaniel-cs-gsce/
- **Structure**:
  - `index.html` - Main landing page with navigation
  - `teacher/index.html` - Teacher resources (lesson plans, answers, progress tracking)
  - `student/index.html` - Student resources (cheat sheets, topic progress)

## Topic Progress Tracking
Keep this updated as lessons are completed:

| Lesson | Specification Section | Topic Name | Date First Covered | Status |
|--------|----------------------|------------|-------------------|---------|
| 000 | Review | Binary/Hex Conversion | TBD | Materials Ready |
| 001 | 2.4 | Boolean Logic Introduction | TBD | Materials Ready |
