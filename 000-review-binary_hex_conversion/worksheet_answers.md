## Question 1: Basic Conversions (8 marks)

a) 1101₂ = **13**
   Working: (1×8) + (1×4) + (0×2) + (1×1) = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13

b) 15 = **1111₂**
   Working: 15 ÷ 2 = 7 r1, 7 ÷ 2 = 3 r1, 3 ÷ 2 = 1 r1, 1 ÷ 2 = 0 r1
   Reading remainders upwards: 1111

c) 2A₁₆ = **42**
   Working: (2×16) + (A×1) = (2×16) + (10×1) = 32 + 10 = 42

d) 35 = **23₁₆**
   Working: 35 ÷ 16 = 2 r3, so 23₁₆

## Question 2: Binary Addition (4 marks)
1011₂ + 1101₂ = **11000₂**

Working:
```
  1011
+ 1101
------
 11000
```
Carry: 1110 (showing carries)

## Question 3: Bit Shifting (4 marks)

a) 1100₂ shifted 1 place left = **11000₂**

b) What does shifting left by 1 place do to the value? 
   **Multiplies the value by 2** (or doubles it)

## Question 4: Mixed Practice (6 marks)

| Binary | Denary | Hexadecimal |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 1010₂  | **10** | **A₁₆**    |
| **10100₂** |  20  | **14₁₆**   |

Working:
- 1010₂ = (1×8)+(0×4)+(1×2)+(0×1) = 10 = A₁₆
- 20 = 10100₂ (20÷2=10r0, 10÷2=5r0, 5÷2=2r1, 2÷2=1r0, 1÷2=0r1)
- 20 = 14₁₆ (20÷16=1r4)

## Question 5: Exam Question (3 marks)
Convert 50 to binary: **110010₂**

Method:
50 ÷ 2 = 25 r0
25 ÷ 2 = 12 r1  
12 ÷ 2 = 6 r0
6 ÷ 2 = 3 r0
3 ÷ 2 = 1 r1
1 ÷ 2 = 0 r1

Reading remainders upwards: 110010₂
